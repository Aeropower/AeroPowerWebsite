        Weâ€™re a student engineering team driven by a passion for renewable energy and real-world impact. At AeroPower, we design, build, and test functional wind turbines, develop full offshore wind farm proposals, and lead outreach initiatives to promote wind energy in our community.

As competitors in the U.S. Department of Energy Collegiate Wind Competition (CWC), we combine innovation with technical precision across three core tracks: turbine engineering, wind farm development, and connection creation with local communities and industry professionals.

Our team is divided into specialized divisions - mechanical, electrical, software, wind farm development, business and operations, and project management, each with focused subteams working on everything from control systems and blade design to power conversion, logistics, and sustainability.

Through hands-on experience in simulation, prototyping, optimization, and outreach, we gain valuable skills in CAD, coding, embedded systems, system modeling, project coordination, and much more all while preparing the next generation of engineers to lead in a sustainable future.
